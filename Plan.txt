Server Setup:
Develop a server application to manage the virtual machine (VM) and handle incoming connections from clients.
Implement features for running the server in the background, allowing it to manage the VM without requiring direct user interaction.
Design the server to support multiple simultaneous connections and provide secure authentication mechanisms.
Peripheral Virtualization:
Investigate USB redirection protocols or virtual USB device emulation techniques compatible with the VM software/hypervisor.
Develop or integrate USB redirection functionality into the server application to allow users to connect peripherals like headphones, keyboard, and mouse to the VM wirelessly.
Ensure seamless integration and compatibility between the server application, VM software/hypervisor, and virtualized USB devices.
Wireless Display Connection:
Research compatibility of the VM software/hypervisor with the Miracast wireless display standard.
Install and configure necessary Miracast drivers and enable Miracast support within the VM.
Connect the VM to the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter wirelessly to mirror the VM's display output to a simple display device.
Ensure optimal display performance, stability, and audio/video synchronization over the wireless connection.
Client Application:
Develop a client application for users to connect to the server and control the VM remotely.
Implement a user-friendly interface with features for initiating connections, authenticating users, and managing VM sessions.
Provide controls for interacting with the VM, such as sending keyboard and mouse inputs, adjusting display settings, and managing audio output.
Ensure cross-platform compatibility of the client application to support a wide range of devices and operating systems.
Testing and Optimization:
Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire system, including the server application, virtualized peripherals, wireless display connection, and client application.
Identify and address any performance bottlenecks, compatibility issues, or usability concerns through iterative testing and optimization.
Optimize network settings, display resolution, and audio/video streaming parameters to enhance user experience and minimize latency.
Documentation and Deployment:
Prepare comprehensive documentation outlining the setup, configuration, and usage instructions for the server application, virtualized peripherals, wireless display connection, and client application.
Package the server and client applications for easy deployment on target platforms, providing installation instructions and troubleshooting guidance as needed.
Distribute the solution to users, ensuring adequate support channels and resources are available for addressing user inquiries and issues.
